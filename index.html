      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm currently taking a coding bootcamp at George Washington University because I'm looking for a career change. 
        I graduated from George Mason University with a Bachelor in Industrial/Organizational Psychology in 2018 and obtained a Master in Human Resources Management from Souther New Hampshire University in 2020. 
        Yep, earlier this year, right before the COVID-19 pandemic. 
        <br><br>
        A couple of months later, I started feeling unsatisfied with my job and I knew it wasn't due to the company or people. 
        I started asking myself, "Is this what I want to do until I retire?". 
        You guessed it, the answer was "No". 
        <br><br>
        So with more time on my hands because traveling was restriced, I started evaluating my interests and strengths and brainstormed the different careers I would be able to say "Yes, I can do this until I retire" to. 
        Anyway, long story short, I got hooked on Software Engineering :)

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Vietnam and raised there for about seven years before I moved to America. 
        I lived in Denver, Colorado for about six years before I moved to Northern Virginia. 
        I haven't moved since.
      </p>
      
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy traveling and exploring different cultures and cuisines. 
        Recently, with the pandemic and traveling being restricted, I picked up cooking so that I can still explore the different cultures and cuisines right in my own home.
      </p>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Right now, something that involves coding :) 
      </p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Because it's fun!
